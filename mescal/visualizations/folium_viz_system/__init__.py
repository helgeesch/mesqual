"""Folium-based visualization system for MESCAL energy system analysis.

This module provides a comprehensive visualization framework built on Folium for creating
interactive maps and geospatial visualizations of energy system data. The system supports
multiple visualization types including areas, lines, markers, icons, and text overlays,
with automatic feature resolution and generation capabilities.

The visualization system follows a modular architecture with:
- Base visualization components for property mapping and feature resolution
- Specialized visualizers for KPI collections and data management
- Multiple visualization feature types (areas, lines, markers, overlays)
- Data item abstractions for model and KPI data integration

Example:
    Basic usage for creating area visualizations:

    >>> from mescal.visualizations.folium_viz_system import AreaGenerator, AreaFeatureResolver
    >>> area_resolver = AreaFeatureResolver(property_mapper)
    >>> area_generator = AreaGenerator()
    >>> area_features = area_resolver.resolve_features(data_items)
    >>> folium_map = area_generator.add_features_to_map(folium_map, area_features)

Attributes:
    The module exports visualization components, feature resolvers, and data abstractions
    for building interactive energy system maps and analysis dashboards.

class BorderFlowCalculator(AreaBorderVariableCalculatorBase):
    """Calculates aggregated power flows for area borders.
    
    This calculator aggregates line-level power flows to border level, handling
    bidirectional flow data and transmission losses.
    The calculator can aggregate both sent and received flows, accounting for
    transmission losses that occur between sending and receiving ends. It supports
    multiple output formats including directional flows and net flows.
    
    Flow aggregation logic:
    - Lines and flows are classified as "up" or "down" based on topological direction
    - Flows are aggregated respecting directionality and loss conventions
    - Net flows represent the algebraic sum (up_flow - down_flow)
    
    Example:

        >>> from mesqual.energy_data_handling.network_lines_data import NetworkLineFlowsData
        >>> calculator = BorderFlowCalculator(
        ...     area_border_model_df, line_model_df, node_model_df, 'country'
        ... )
        >>> # Calculate net sent flows (before losses)
        >>> net_flows = calculator.calculate(flow_data, flow_type='sent', direction='net')
        >>> print(net_flows)

        Sums power flows of all lines belonging to each border, respecting flow
        directionality and transmission loss conventions. The aggregation handles
        both pre-loss (sent) and post-loss (received) flows.
        
        Flow type selection:
        - 'sent': Flows before transmission losses (injected into lines)  
        - 'received': Flows after transmission losses (withdrawn from lines)
        
        Direction options:
        - 'up': Flows from area_from to area_to only
        - 'down': Flows from area_to to area_from only
        - 'net': Net flows (up - down), positive means net export from area_from
        
        The method handles missing data by preserving NaN values when all 
        constituent flows are missing for a given timestamp.
        
        Args:
            line_flow_data: NetworkLineFlowsData containing bidirectional flow
                time series. Must include sent_up, received_up, sent_down, and
                received_down DataFrames with line IDs as columns.
            flow_type: Type of flows to aggregate:
                - 'sent': Pre-loss flows (power injected into transmission)
                - 'received': Post-loss flows (power withdrawn after losses)
            direction: Flow direction to calculate:
                - 'up': Flows from area_from → area_to
                - 'down': Flows from area_to → area_from  
                - 'net': Net flows (up - down)
                
        Returns:
            DataFrame with border-level flow aggregations. Index matches input
            flow data, columns are border identifiers. Values represent power
            flows in MW. For net flows, positive values indicate net export
            from area_from to area_to.

class GeoModelGeneratorBase:
    """Base class for generating geometric models with representative points.
    
    This class provides common functionality for working with geometric representations
    of energy system areas, including methods for computing representative points
    within polygons and multipolygons. It's designed to support energy market
    analysis where spatial aggregation of nodes into areas is required.
    
    The class supports two methods for computing representative points:
    - 'polylabel': Uses pole of inaccessibility algorithm for optimal label placement
    - 'representative_point': Uses Shapely's built-in representative point method
    
    Attributes:
        REPRESENTATIVE_POINT_METHOD (str): Method used for computing representative
            points ('polylabel' or 'representative_point')
        _polylabel_cache (dict): Cache for expensive polylabel calculations
